| Overview: |
+-----------+    
    
    This program allows the user to implement a password protection scheme
for the Texas Instrument TI-85 graphing calculator.  The password can be 
up to 8 characters long, uppercase alphabet only.

+--------+
| Usage: |
+--------+
    
    To run the program press the custom menu key.  This should show Zshell as
Custom Menu number 1.  Select it with the f1 key.  From the menu choose
pwprot.  The program will prompt the user for a menu of changing passwords,
shutting down, or quit.  
    To change passwords select option 2, by hitting the 2 button.  
The calculator will prompt you for the password, enter it bytyping it on 
the calculator keys.  When you have completed the password hit enter.  The 
calculator will then print the password you have entered and ask if it is 
correct or not.  If it is correct select 1, and the calculatorwill display 
password changed.  If you have have not entered the password correctly 
choose option 2, and the calculator will display "Password Not Changed" 
and return to the main menu.
    To shut down and use the password protection feature choose option
1 from the main menu.  The calculator will promptly turn itself off.  When
the on key is pressed pwprot will prompt you to enter a password if it is
correct the calculator will return to normal operating mode.  If it is 
incorrect, the calculator will turn itself off again.

    PWProt was written in Z80 Assembly language and compiled using the
Table Assembler Ver 3.0.1.  It was then converted to a TI-85 type string
using string85.com program written by Dan Eble for use ZShell.
    Some Assembly code from the Texanoid ver 1.00 program were used. 
specifically, the input one character routine, and the letter table. This
author is very appreciative of the distribution of that program by its
author Magnus Hagander.
    This program currently consumes too much power while in the 'off' mode
and ways to avoid wasteful battery power lossage are being investigated.

| Caution: |
+----------+

    Do not forget your password, there is no backdoor.  If you do forget your 
password after running the program, you must remove your batteries to shut
off the calculator.  This will cause you to lose everything in memory.
    I cannot be held responsible for any damage that may occur after using 
my program, or any data that is lost.  etc, etc.  By using this program
you agree to not hold the author responsible for any damage or data lossage 
that may occur.  
    Questions or comments can be directed to the author at:
        ai150@detroit.freenet.org
    
    or posted to the bit.listserv.calc-ti mailing list or the Zshell mailing
list, as I am regular reader of both.
	Reminder:

    The default password is 'BOO'.  (This is a nickname of mine).  You will
need to know this to change passwords.
